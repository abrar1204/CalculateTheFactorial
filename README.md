# CalculateTheFactorial
This program can calculate the factorial of a number. The factorial of a number is the product of an interger (ex. 6) and all the intergers below that interger (ex. for 6, it would be 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1).  6! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 720. 

Run the program and the program will ask what number you want to calculate the factorial of.
